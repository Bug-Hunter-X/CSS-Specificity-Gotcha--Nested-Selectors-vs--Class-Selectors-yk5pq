The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is intended to override the color of paragraph elements within div elements */
}

.special-paragraph {
  color: purple; /* This rule uses a class selector and has higher specificity */
}
```

The unexpected behavior might arise when `.special-paragraph` class is applied to a `<p>` element inside a `<div>`.  Due to specificity rules, the `color: purple;` declaration will override `color: green;` even though the latter seems more specific based on element nesting.  In some situations developers might mistakenly believe that the nested selector `div p` is more specific and the `color: green` should take precedence.
