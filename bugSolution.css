The solution involves understanding CSS Specificity and adjusting the CSS to ensure the desired styles are applied:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

/*Increased specificity to override the class selector */
div .special-paragraph {
  color: green; 
}

.special-paragraph {
  color: purple;
}
```

Alternatively, adjust the order of declarations to favor the intended style:

```css
.special-paragraph {
  color: purple;
}
div p {
  color: green; /* This will take precedence if declared after .special-paragraph */
}
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```
By using more specific selectors, or placing the more specific rule after the less specific one, we ensure the correct color is applied.
